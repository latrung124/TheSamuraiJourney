1.	Game Title
The Samuraiâ€™s Journey.
2.	Game Overview
The game is a 2D action-adventure game with a samurai as the main character on a quest to rescue his shogun. The game will have three main scenes: a forest, a snow mountain, and an enemy barracks. Before moving on to the next scene, the samurai will have to defeat a boss in each scene.

In the forest scene, the samurai will have to navigate through the forest while avoiding or defeating enemies such as skeletons or wild animals. The boss for this scene could be a powerful monster who is causing trouble in the forest.

In the snow mountain scene, the samurai will have to fight through harsh weather conditions while battling against enemies such as snow monsters or enemy soldiers. The boss for this scene could be a giant yeti-like monster or a rival samurai.

In the enemy barracks scene, the samurai will have to infiltrate the enemy base while fighting against enemy soldiers and generals. The boss for this scene could be a skilled enemy general who is responsible for the capture of the samurai's shogun.

Throughout the game, the samurai will have various actions such as attacking, defending, jumping, running, and walking. He will also encounter various NPCs who can give him quests or provide him with items or information.

The combat system will be based on a simple algorithm where both the samurai and the enemies have health points and can attack, dodge, or use special moves. The samurai will be able to block or parry attacks, but enemies will not be able to dodge attacks. If the samurai or the enemies get hit, they will enter a hurt state, cancel their current action, and play a hurt animation.
Overall, the game aims to provide an engaging and challenging experience for players who enjoy action-adventure games with a Japanese samurai theme.
